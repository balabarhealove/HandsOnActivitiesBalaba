	<p>I suck at telling my stories, so I'll share the deep meaning of my name instead, Rhealove Ariane has two meanings. Firstly, it comes from my parents' names, Roel and Arlyn. They combined their names for their love, Roel loves Arlyn, Rhea loves Ariane. Secondly, it's Greek meaning, Rhea in Greek means Flow or Stream, love literally means love, and Ariane means most holy. In Conclusion, I'm the holiest stream/flow of love. Relevant fonds: Sports, Dancing, Guitar, Music, Movies, Reading, and sometimes writing. -_-</p>
